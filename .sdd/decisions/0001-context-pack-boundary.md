# Decision: derive packs on demand

The repository is the durable source of truth for specifications, decisions,
and links to evidence. A context pack is a generated view, never a second
mutable database. This makes handoffs reviewable in a diff and prevents an
old generated pack from silently overriding a newer decision.

The generator must therefore record the source revision, apply status and
expiry filtering at generation time, and report budget omissions.
